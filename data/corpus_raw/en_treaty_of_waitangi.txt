The Treaty of Waitangi (M훮ori: Te Tiriti o Waitangi), sometimes referred to as Te Tiriti, is a document of central importance to the history of New Zealand, its constitution, and its national mythos. It has played a major role in the treatment of the M훮ori people in New Zealand by successive governments and the wider population, something that has been especially prominent from the late 20th century. Although the Treaty of Waitangi is not incorporated as a binding international treaty within New Zealand's domestic law, its status at international law is debated. It was first signed on 6 February 1840 by Captain William Hobson as consul for the British Crown and by M훮ori chiefs (rangatira) from the North Island of New Zealand. The treaty's status has clouded the question of whether M훮ori had ceded sovereignty to the Crown in 1840, and if so, whether such sovereignty remains intact
